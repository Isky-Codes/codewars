A repository that will be used to store solutions from CodeWars challenges (kata). Aim to push 5 solutions a week by increasing difficulty. Completed over +70 challenges and reached 6Kyu.

# How It's Made:
Tech Used: Javascript

I aim to solve a minimum of three CodeWars based on my current experience by increasing difficulty!

# Optimizations

I look back at some of the solutions here to see how I can either make my code more efficient or readable and improve any future code I write.

# Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I have learn so far in solving these challenges is that there are always gaps in my knowledge which these challenges are consistently helping me to fill and therefore being able to improve on my coding ability. Getting stuck on a challenge is no issue as long as there is a drive to see <i>how</i> you can solve it and learn along the way!
